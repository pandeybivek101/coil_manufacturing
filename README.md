# coal_manufacturing
This coal manufacturing data preprocessing and storage project is built entirely in the Azure environment, leveraging services like Azure Data Lake, Azure Databricks, Azure Key Vault, and Databricks Access Connector.

The project follows a data lakehouse architecture with three layers: bronze (raw, least curated data), silver (cleaned and transformed data), and gold (highly curated, business-level aggregated data).
